# Introduction to Logistic Regression (Statistic Modeling/ Machine Learning)

<p>
Logistical regression is a technique used to solved classification problems by predicting whether something is true or false instead of a continuous value. For example, it can be used to determine whether someone is obese or not obese as in the figure below. Here we have a Binary Classification where there are only two categories, is Obese and not Obese. However, a classification can involve multiple categories aptly named Multiclass Classification. You can think of this as a model predicting whether someone will vote democratic, republican, or independent as a Multiclass Classification where there are 3 categories.
